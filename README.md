## Project Overview

This project is a scalable, serverless contact form application leveraging **AWS Cloud** infrastructure using AWS CDK, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. It includes a simple frontend interface for submitting messages and a backend infrastructure to handle, process, and store submissions securely and efficiently.

---

## Features

- Serverless architecture on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- Infrastructure as code using AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- Simple, responsive frontend form
- Secure data storage and processing
- Easy to deploy and maintain
- Automated tests for infrastructure

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda (Node.js)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- **Database:** AWS DynamoDB
- **Deployment:** AWS CloudFormation via CDK

---

## Architecture

User --> Frontend Form --> API Gateway --> AWS Lambda --> DynamoDB

- The frontend captures user input and sends it to API Gateway.
- API Gateway triggers AWS Lambda function.
- Lambda validates and stores data into DynamoDB.
